# About

All in One media tracker. Pulls the cover art/summary/rating/etc from db sites.
Will never show you where to read and find them.
Simply a tracker.
For all forms of media, BUT music (too many good music libraries, don't need another one, maybe if enough people want it)

**IMPORTANT**

Only option as of 11/20 is to manually add your form of media. As I have not worked on the scraping/pulling of summries/coverart. This is just the template/baseline

## Potentially

would just show name and error if cannot find (if multiple options show up, gives the user option to select preferred/correct version)

pulls from ani-planet imdb etc

cover art, tags, rating, author, etc (more tags, reading/watch and still ongoing)

library distribution stats(manhwa, manga, light novel, movie, show)

mass list import (line by line or comma)

backed up to device (data stored on device)

tracker for new chapter/update (manually enter the site you are reading on or default to novelupdates/anilist/etc) (also option to add the site you are reading on)

if there is novel, manga and anime available ask which ones to import and when clicking on the media it will show if other forms of it are available

self hosted (maybe mobile app)

all on device, no online community section, potential online login if deployed to web

maybe community plugins? (manually import plugin)

proxy support and rotation (if rate limited)

IF ai integration (provide own api key, separate section on sidebar, pulls library for info, find similar or find what to watch from library)

custom themes

translations/multi language support (how would you translate the summary and tags etc)

syncing?

### Ideology

**Questions:** uhhhhhhh
